                          <p>I have been completing the comprehensive Front End Engineer course on Codecademy alongside my job as a teacher. 
                            I feel the course has had a good mix of studying theory and taking on projects to apply the knowledge. 
                            I have enjoyed my work on Codecademy - particularly the noticeable progress I continue to make in each strand on the career path.</p>

                            <p>Establishing strong positive relationships with staff and students, I quickly developed a 
                              supportive environment for working and learning. My main role has been to teach students to 
                              a high standard and to support students in their lives, helping them to build support networks 
                              where necessary. Whilst here I have created a bank of high quality teaching resources for 
                              the entire department, supported in the running of the department and helped to resolve any 
                              issues that arose each day. I have also worked with individual students, staff and parents to 
                              create bespoke educational plans to support their learning.

                              In January 2023 I took on a secondment as the Head of Faculty. In addition to my roles 
                              above, this role involved working closely with members of senior management to drive an 
                              increase in results and standards across the department and wider school. I represented my 
                              department at trust-level meetings, debating a range of ideas that would affect staff and 
                              students. My experience of managing staff included some difficult conversations but also 
                              many supportive and valuable discussions that helped to support them in their professional 
                              development and personal wellbeing.</p>
